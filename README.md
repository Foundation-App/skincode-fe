# Skincode.app

Welcome to SkinCode() an AI powered app designed to help you find your perfect foundation match. With this app a user is able to upload an image of themselves, and as a result are recommended a few foundations that closely match their skin tone. One of the main problems we were hoping to solve with this technology, is that most folks of color have a difficult time finding their foundation shades, especially if they only have access to drugstores where you’re not allowed to test before buying. This is due to the historic lack of representation in the beauty industry for darker skinned folks, and that’s something that we heavily took into consideration when creating the app. In the beginning of our sprint we began researching similar technologies that already exist we didn’t really come across many AI powered foundation matchers. Most required you to have an already existing perfect foundation match to reference, we found this to be counter productive as people looking for a new foundation, likely don’t have one that already matches well. With SkinCode() you have an easily accessible tool created with a diverse user demographic in mind.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
